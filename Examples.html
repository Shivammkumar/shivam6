<body>
<div>
    <p>The display property in CSS controls how an HTML 
        element is displayed on the page. Each value of 
        the display property has specific use cases.
    </p>
</div>    

<!-- Block Level Element -->
<div class="block">Block Level Element (Default)
    <p>
        Block-level elements stack on top of each other and 
        stretch the full width of their container. Common 
        block-level elements include div, p, h1 to h6, 
        and ul, ol, li.
    </p>
</div>
<!-- Inline Level Element -->
<div>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line and only 
        take up as much width as necessary. 
        Common inline elements include span, a, 
        strong
    
        <span class="inline">Inline Level Element</span>
    </p>
</div>
<!-- Inline-Block Level Element -->
<div >
    <p> Inline-block combines features of both block and 
        inline. It allows elements to flow inline like inline 
        elements, but you can set their width, height, margin, 
        and padding like block-level elements. Useful for 
        creating grid layouts or arranging elements horizontally.
        <span class="inline-block">Inline-Block Level Element</span>
    </p>
</div>
<!-- None - Hidden Element -->
<div>
    <p>The none value hides the element, making it 
        invisible and removing it from the layout. This 
        is commonly used for toggling visibility based on 
        certain conditions, such as in JavaScript for 
        showing/hiding elements dynamically.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="none">This element is hidden (display: none)</div>

<!-- Flex Container -->
<div class="flex-container">
    <p>Flexbox is a layout model designed for 
        one-dimensional layouts. It's used to create 
        flexible and responsive layouts with easy 
        alignment and distribution of space among items 
        in a container. Great for building navigation 
        bars, sidebars, or any flexible layout.</p>
    <div class="block">Flex Item 1</div>
    <div class="block">Flex Item 2</div>
    <div class="block">Flex Item 3</div>
</div>

<!-- Grid Container -->
<div>
    <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that 
        allows you to create complex grid-based layouts 
        with rows and columns. It's powerful for creating 
        overall page structure, especially for web 
        applications and complex websites.
