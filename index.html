        <h1>Character reference</h1>
        <p> An HTML character reference is an escape sequence of characters that is used to represent another character in the rendered web page.</p>
        <p>Character references are used as replacements for characters that are reserved in HTML, such as the less-than (<) and greater-than (>) symbols used by the HTML parser to identify element tags, or " or ' within attributes, which may be enclosed by those characters. They can also be used for invisible characters that would otherwise be impossible to type, including non-breaking spaces, control characters like left-to-right and right-to-left marks, and for characters that are hard to type on a standard keyboard.</p>
        <p>There are three types of character references:</p>
        <h1>There are three types of character references:</h1>
        <p> These use a name string between an ampersand (&) and a semicolon (;) to refer to the corresponding character. For example, &lt; is used for the less-than (<) symbol, and &copy; for the copyright symbol (Â©). The string used for the reference is often a camel-cased initialization or contraction of the character name.</p>
        <h2>Decimal numeric character references</h2>
        <p>These references start with &#, followed by one or more ASCII digits representing the base-ten integer that corresponds to the character's Unicode code point, and ending with ;. For example, the decimal character reference for < is &#60;, because the Unicode code point for the symbol is U+0003C, and 3C hexadecimal is 60 in decimal.</p>
        <h3>Hexadecimal numeric character references</h3>
        <p>These references start with &#x or &#X, followed by one or more ASCII hex digits, representing the hexadecimal integer that corresponds to the character's Unicode code point, and ending with ;. For example, the hexadecimal character reference for < is &#x3C; or &#X3C;, because the Unicode code point for the symbol is U+0003C.</p>
        <p>A very small subset of useful named character references along with their unicode code points are listed below.</p>
